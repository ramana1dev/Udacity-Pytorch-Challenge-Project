# Udacity-Pytorch-Challenge-Project

This is the project assigned by Udacity Pytorch Scholars Phase-1 , which classifies species of Flowers.This is classified by implementing Transfer Learning which uses Pre-trained Model which consists previously initialized weights.

Since the test set is not available for evaluating the model on test set.
The better accuracy can be achieved using Resnet-152 with more number of epochs ideally 50 epochs is a good number.
